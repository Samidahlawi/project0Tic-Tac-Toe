## wireframes and user stories.
- As a user, I need a play again button to play a new game. 
- As a user, I need to kkeep track the score for each player. 
- As a user, I need to know who's turn in the game.
- As a user, I need select between X or O to get started. 
- As a user, I need to see a message who is the winner. 
- As a user, I need hear some of sound effect to react with the game. 
- As a user, I shouldn't be able to click to any button when game is starting except play again. 
- As a user, I shouldn't be able to click to any index of the board if I didn't select any mark to start (X or O). 

## The process of developing the game:
1. Starting with a simple HTML file and few CSS.
2. Simplify the problem to small steps and do them one by one.
3. Started with every time I click on the boxes put X in it.
4. Let them alternate between X and O.
5. Store each move in an array.
6. Get the winner by checking if any line has a matching symbol after the fifth move if it reaches nine moves without winner it will be a tie.
7. Get the score for each player and display it underneath the board.
8. Be able to start a new game without refresh the page or lose the scores by click on `New Game`.
9. Add some sound effects when clicking on the boxes and if someone wins or ties
10. Add AI player to play against by clicking `Play Against AI`.

## Planning and Development Process
Planning started with searching and exploring different options and ways to build the game with an open mind
then: 

Day 1:
- Basic html layout
- Basic styling with css
- Adding special classes and IDs to html elements
- Building jQuery lines to enable clicks actions 
- Using developer tools all the way from here 

Day 2:
- Defining variables and building functions to use in jQuery to: manipulate page's content
- Defining winning scenarios, psudocode them
- Building  winning functions, along with ``turn()`` , ``tie()`` , ``reset()`` functions 
- Debugging functions

Day 3:
- Discussing, sharing thoughts on solving problems 
- Debugging and fixing JavaScript bugs 
- Adding a feature so the first player gets to pick X or O to play as
- Adding a feature to track and show winning/tie ``score()``
- Working on page styles and making it responsive 

Day 4:
- Adding sound feature
- Adding play vs computer feature
- Update ``winner()`` function
- Final touches on html, css and jQuery

## Challenges
How to determine the correct boxs like when boxs matched or not. 



# unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
- add option if the user want to play with (X or O) or with images or their names. 
- add a timer
